# How To Upgrade From 0.8.x to 0.9.x

Cloak `0.9.0` encrypts and decrypts data up to 200% faster than `0.8.0`.
This result is achieved by caching configuration data in an ETS table.

- **Breaking Change**: You must now add your `Cloak.Vault` to your
  supervision tree.

## Update Your Dependency

Update your `cloak` dependency to `0.9.0` or higher:

```elixir
{:cloak, "~> 0.9.0"}
```

### Supervise Your Vault

Add your vault to your supervision tree:

    children = [
      MyApp.Vault
    ]
