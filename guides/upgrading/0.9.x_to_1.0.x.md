# How To Upgrade From 0.9.x to 1.0.x

Cloak 1.0.0 separated the `Ecto` components into a separate package:
`cloak_ecto`. This required some breaking name changes.

- Cloak's default JSON library is now `Jason`, not `Poison`
- All `Ecto`-related modules now have the prefix `Cloak.Ecto`.
- Cloak's `Ecto` types have a new naming scheme: `Cloak.Fields.Binary` became
  `Cloak.Ecto.Binary`.
- `mix cloak.migrate` has been renamed to `mix cloak.migrate.ecto`.

### Install `cloak_ecto` 1.0.0

Replace your `cloak` dependency with `cloak_ecto`.

    {:cloak_ecto, "1.0.0"}

### Configure JSON Library

If you have not specified the `:json_library` setting in your Vault, and want
to continue using Poison, you will need to add that setting:

    config :my_app, MyApp.Vault,
      json_library: Poison,
      # ...

Otherwise, you will need to add `Jason` to your dependencies:

    {:jason, "~> 1.0"}

### Update Cloak Field References

Update all your Cloak field references from the old naming scheme to the new.
For example:

    use Cloak.Fields.Binary, vault: MyApp.Vault

Should now become:

    use Cloak.Ecto.Binary, vault: MyApp.Vault

### Update Migration References

If you use `Cloak.Migrator` directly, rename your references to
`Cloak.Ecto.Migrator` instead. If you use `mix cloak.migrate`, rename any
references to `mix cloak.migrate.ecto` instead..
