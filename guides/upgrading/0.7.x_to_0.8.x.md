# How To Upgrade From 0.7.x to 0.8.x

Cloak `0.8` introduces a new feature with **no breaking changes**.

- `mix cloak.migrate` now supports binary primary keys. It iterates
  through database tables using a cursor, instead of min/max ID.

- `Cloak.CustomCursor` allows you to customize fields used for the cursor.

## Update Your Dependency

Update your `cloak` dependency to `0.8` or later.

```elixir
{:cloak, "~> 0.8.0"}
```

Most users will not need to do anything more. See the `Cloak.CustomCursor`
docs for more details.
